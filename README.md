1. pros and cons of role-based access control
2. distributed role-based access control

## Configuration Instructions

## Alternative Implementation Considerations

* use signed extension for tx pool level verification
    * explain pros/cons
* generate OpenGov-usable origin + assign in runtime explicitly
* impl_for_tupl to stack ValidateCall filters

## Use Case Examples

* control over deployment/updates of specific smart contracts
* easily revoke access, timed access, etc
